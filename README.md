# Employee Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a **Machine Learning model using Linear Regression** to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience. It demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and visualization to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Salary prediction is a common real-world regression problem in Human Resource analytics.  
The objective of this project is to **predict an employee’s salary** given their **years of experience**, using a supervised learning approach.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand the relationship between experience and salary
- Apply **Linear Regression** to a real dataset
- Visualize trends and model performance
- Evaluate the model using standard regression metrics
- Build a reusable prediction system

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Type:** Supervised Learning  
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Target Variable:** Salary  
- **Input Feature:** Years of Experience

  Linear Regression was chosen because:
- The relationship between experience and salary is linear
- It is simple, interpretable, and effective for beginners
- It provides strong baseline performance for regression problems
